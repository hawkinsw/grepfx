# Grep within files with a matching extension #

`grepfx` searches within files whose extension matches the
extension passed to `grepfx` as its first positional argument.

## Usage ##

`grepfx <extension> [normal grep parameters]`

*N:B*: `grepfx` does not automatically prepend a `.` to ``extension`.
